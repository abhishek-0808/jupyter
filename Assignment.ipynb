These expressions can include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex operations.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nConsider the following arithmetic expre\n\n(5 + 3) * 2 - 7\n\n\r\nIn this expression:\r\n- The numbers `5`, `3`, `2`, and `7` are operands.\r\n- The symbols `+`, `*`, and `-` are operators.\r\n- The expression is evaluated following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\r\n  1. Parentheses/Brackets\r\n  2. Exponents/Orders\r\n  3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\r\n  4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\r\n\r\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\r\n\r\n1. `(5 + 3)` evaluates to `8`.\r\n2. `8 * 2` evaluates to `16`.\r\n3. `16 - 7` evaluates to `9`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the result of the expression `(5 + 3) * 2 - 7` is `9`.\r\nssion:\r\n\r\n",
